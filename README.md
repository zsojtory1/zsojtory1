## Software Development Projects
  - Worked with state machines to design and implement a user friendly flashlight simulation in python.
  - Established a system in SQL based on the relationships of entities in a university (lecturer, tutor, student, etc.).
  - Wrote machine code which performs elementary operations on ordered lists such as insertion, deletion, and search.
  - Used LaTeX to complete projects based on mathematical equations
  - Worked in-depth with sorting algorithms in Java such as quick sort, insertion sort and merge sort, studying different variants and how these variants alter the time complexities of standard operations.
  - Implemented a variety of abstract data structures (queues, stacks, binary trees, etc.) in Java, focusing on the time complexities of standard operations.
  - Refactored pre-existing Java code to improve efficiency and usability.
  - Applied the visitor design pattern in Java to find useless control flows and recursions in pre written code.
  - Collaborated in a group of five to develop a web app (Glasgow University Book Repository) using the Django framework in Python along with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The app allows users to upload, vote on and search for textbooks.
  - Implemented a file transfer system over TCP/IP via Python code.
  - Worked with a variety of scheduling algorithms in Python.
  - Developed a website monitoring (tracking access to a website based on country) in C, with appropriate memory allocation.
  - Refactored a concurrent dependency discoverer algorithm to be multithreaded in C++.
  - Participated in peer-review exercises for a number of these projects.
  - Worked with a variety of compression algorithms (Huffman, LZW, etc.) in finding out their compression ratios in Java.
  - Implemented various data processing algorithms including basic optimisation in numpy (python).
  - Designed and programmed a simple host-side driver routine to interact with an OpenCL-compliant device in C, along with corresponding peer-review.
  - Worked in a team to develop an online multiplayer card game in Unity over 7 months, while practising industry standard professional methods (online repositories, code reviews, etc.).
  - Used the compiler generator tool ANTLR to extend an existing basic compiler including syntactic analysis, contextual analysis, and code generation.
  - Researched, designed and developed a program which handles automated exercise and solution generation for chosen algorithmics courses, using Java, LaTeX and GitHub. (Level 4 Dissertation, year-long project)
  - Applied discrete state-space search methods in Python (including designing states and actions) to minimise the Mondrian score of variable sized squares.
  - Worked in a team to develop an efficient batch-based text search and filtering pipeline in Apache Spark, which works in big data systems.
  - Collaborated in a team to calculate the expected number of block accesses of given SQL queries on different data structures.
  - Implemented a simple programming language (Turtle) using functional programming in Haskell.
  - Used machine learning techniques to create and analyse document-topic and topic-word dirichlet distributions.
  - Evaluated the performance of different natural language processing models at classifying lines from the show South Park to their corresponding characters.
  - Conducted experiments comparing the performance of MiniZinc constraint program and integer program solvers on the same problem
  - Worked in MiniZinc as well as other constraint programming tools to solve NP-hard problems
  - Developed an image inpainting tool using DCGAN in Pytorch
  - Designed and developed a custom ChatGPT tool for Large Language Model-aided pair programming specifically for algorithm tracing.
